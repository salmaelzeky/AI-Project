You're basically in a cube, trying to solve each side of the cube to "break it open" and escape.

Here's a diagram!					
-----------------------------------------------------

        North -v      _.-+							
                 _.-""     '						
             +:""            '						
             | \  v Top Side   '					
              | \             _.-+					
              |  '.       _.-"   |					
    West -->  |    \  _.-"       |  <-- East  	
               |    +"           |	 		
               +    | South->    | 					
                \   |          .+ 				
                 \  |       .-'					
                  \ |    .-'	<-- Ground/Center		
                   \| .-'							
                    +'

You can travel to any adjcent wall, but not across.  The game will tell you there is a gap in space. 	
Unfolding walls will change this system.	

You should get 5 or more solved puzzles in oreder to escape from the map. And in order to escape, you should go the ground level.
